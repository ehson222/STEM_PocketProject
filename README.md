**team members**: Pritika Banerjee (project lead, lead programmer), Michelle Abreu (Assistant Project lead), 
Ehson Assani (lead Chatbot programmer)

## Our Goal

### 
Started thinking about college? are you indecisive with degree options? want to change majors? who do you want to become in the next 5 years?  If you have any of these questions, why not try our app, STEM Pocket Project.  Our app was designed on the basics of your interests, regardless of your experience, we will guide you to a career path that more suites who you want to become in the near future.

## The how's and why's

Although the sound of achieving a degree in any of the STEM disciplines may sound appealing.  It does have a negative connotation surrounding the challenges you must overcome.  Soo much so that our project lead, Pritika was scolded for her name and background and told that she would never make it in STEM.

SweetWifi works primarily through crowdsourced data, it's how Waze app works on your mobile phone.  After you login your credentials to your account, we will store your location and all wifi connections that you have access to (if it is a private connection, as long as you have logged in through the app, we will remember it for you).  Then through our online database (we would choose Amazon DynamoDB as Amazon would handle all the upkeep), we would automatically swap connections for you based on our algorithm.  The algorithm would look at our database for a list of past changes in router strength, the time of day the strength is at it's worst and for how long, current strength of nearest routers and then give each router a score.  It's main priority is to choose reliability, secondary would be fastest connection near you.

## Results:

Although we did not win any awards, we definitely learned valuable lessons to apply next time (I was fortunate enough to win my next hackathon at HackAttack QC).  Primarily we were new to android studio, online databases and how they should work, time constraints were as real as ever (24 hour hackathon) and coming up with ideas that would work.
